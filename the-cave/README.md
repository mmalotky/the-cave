# Project Description
This project is a ground-up application that employs react and greensock to create a basic game engine. The intent of this project is educational and not intended for a production setting.

## App Features
Start Menu
Save game progress (in progress)
Pause/Start game
Keylogging for in-game controls
Level-based Rendering of maps, entities, and effects
Gameover/restart level
Timer-based rendering

## In-Game Features
Inventory/item unlocks
Smooth character Movement/ direction-based interaction and animation
Map Features (obstables, readable items, level finish)
Entities (collisions, unlocks, drops, dialogue, movement, sightlines, gameover)
In-game messages/alerts
Effects (shadows)
Level switching/smooth level transitions

## Game Description
Navigate the Map using movement controls (WASD) and interacting with the environment (F). Some entities are hostile and will cause game over if they catch you. Look for keys to locked doors. Find secrets on the map to give you hints along the way. Find the exit to start the next level.

ESC will pause the game an give the user the option of exiting the menu screen or continuing to play. Pausing will cause the ingame timer to stop as well as player and entitity movement. Unpausing will resume from the point when the user pause the game.

Game over may be triggered if the user is caught by an entity with a gameover trait. Gameover will give the user the choice of quitting or restarting the level.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
